## What Decentralized Identity?
Decentralized Identity (DID) is a concept of digital identity management that does not rely on centralized third parties (such as governments, banks, or large tech companies) to verify a person's or entity's identity. Instead, the identity is managed by the individual or entity itself using blockchain or other distributed technologies.

Here are some key points about Decentralized Identity:
- User Control: With DID, individuals have full control over their digital identity, without relying on central institutions or service providers. This reduces the risk of misuse of personal data.
- Security and Privacy: Decentralized identity uses technologies like blockchain to ensure that identity data cannot be tampered with without authorization, improving security and maintaining privacy. Only necessary information for verification is shared, while sensitive data is kept protected.
- Trusted Verification: These identities can be validated through verifiable credentials (VCs), which are digital signatures that can be verified by others without needing a central authority.
- Interoperability: With DID, digital identities can be used across various platforms and services without needing to create new identities on each one. This improves convenience and efficiency while reducing the risk of data leaks.
- Blockchain Technology Usage: Many DID solutions are built using blockchain technology, which allows identities to be stored in a distributed and secure way. This ensures that identities remain protected without the need for a central entity to control or manipulate the data.
